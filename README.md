## Instructions for build
Installation is done through Spack. If you don't have Spack installed or if Spack is new to you. I use spack **0.23.0.dev0 (05357052ac29981fb57c3d1e923a1eb86c470cfd)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git ~/spack
cd ~/spack
. share/spack/setup-env.sh
```


```bash
git clone https://github.com/YosefQiu/spack_test.git
chmod +777 /path/to/spack_test/install.sh
source /path/to/spack_test/install.sh
```
